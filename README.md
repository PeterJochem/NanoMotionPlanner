# NanoMotionPlanner
This is a motion planner for robotic arms written entirely in Python. It only depends on Numpy and Pytest!

# Results
I have implemented a lot of fundamental robotics and planning algorithms.

## Robotics Algorithms
1. Triangle-Triangle Collision Checking
2. Mesh-Mesh Collision Checking
3. Robot Self Collision Checking
4. Forward Kinematics via Screw Theory
5. Inverse Kinematics via the Newton Raphson Method

## Planning Algorithms
1. RRT
2. RRT Connect
3. More to Come!

# Running the Tests
pytest ./tests
